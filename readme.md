I've always wanted to have a safe place to manage my dotfiles, and it's gotten more crucial the more I use POP OS.

I had originally followed this setup from [this topic on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797).

I enjoyed that method for a few weeks but I found it very difficult to manage and navigate my `~/.dotfiles` repo. I've gotten use to a more traditional approach of managing my repos.

So today with the help of this helpful [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10637378/how-do-i-convert-a-bare-git-repository-into-a-normal-one-in-place), I converted my bare repo into a normal one :)

### MUCH BETTER!
